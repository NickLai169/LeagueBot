<<<<<< commit efdbf0cf3f99333ebac3e707cbe7dd008b0bcf70 >>>>>>
I am now up to the bit where I need to set key bindings

- Created Tester.py
- Created notes.txt

I realised that it might be important to create a side-program that logs keys and clicks
and then saves it somewhere, allowing the user to access those exact keys and clicks
in the future. I will probably initiate a side-project now.

I realised that I need to be able to use keys and pyautogui is slightly too old
and has some deprecated libraries. So I am using pydirectinput for key inputs


<<<<<<<<{{{ commit f123aa868b4fd2e8591046a46fee4439d52791a7 }}}>>>>>>>>
pyautogui has the bug where it wouldn't release the keys. I will resolve this
issue using pynput, will need to rework framework of everyhing later.

SUMMARY:
- Locating stuff and moving the mouse there: pyautogui
  - This is because pyautogui actually supports locating via image
- Pressing keys on the keyboard: pydirectinput
  - This is beccause pynput is unable to actually input keystrokes into league
- Mouse clicks: pyinput
  - This is because pyautogui is unable to release mousekeys when pressed.
These are the best ways to do things
