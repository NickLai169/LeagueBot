<<<<<< commit efdbf0cf3f99333ebac3e707cbe7dd008b0bcf70 >>>>>>
I am now up to the bit where I need to set key bindings

- Created Tester.py
- Created notes.txt

I realised that it might be important to create a side-program that logs keys and clicks
and then saves it somewhere, allowing the user to access those exact keys and clicks
in the future. I will probably initiate a side-project now.

I realised that I need to be able to use keys and pyautogui is slightly too old
and has some deprecated libraries. So I am using pydirectinput for key inputs
